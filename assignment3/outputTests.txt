Remote User: SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.

Remote User: Enter ROMEO

Remote User: ROMEO

Remote User: He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

Remote User: JULIET appears above at a window

Remote User: 

Remote User: But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?

Remote User: It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

Remote User: Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,

Remote User: Who is already sick and pale with grief,

Remote User: That thou her maid art far more fair than she:

Remote User: Be not her maid, since she is envious;

Remote User: Her vestal livery is but sick and green

Remote User: And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.

Remote User: It is my lady, O, it is my love!

Remote User: O, that she knew she were!

Remote User: 

Remote User: She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?

Remote User: Her eye discourses; I will answer it.

Remote User: I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:

Remote User: Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,

Remote User: Having some business, do entreat her eyes

Remote User: To twinkle in their spheres till they return.

Remote User: What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
